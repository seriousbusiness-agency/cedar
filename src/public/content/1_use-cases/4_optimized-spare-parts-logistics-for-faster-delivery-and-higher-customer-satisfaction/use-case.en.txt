Blocks: [{"content":{"title":"The problem","text":"ILLIG Maschinenbau GmbH & Co. KG, based in Heilbronn, is a leading provider of thermoforming and packaging systems as well as tools for cardboard, paper, and plastic. Spare parts management at ILLIG had previously been a secondary focus, as the company primarily concentrated on new machinery. The mixed storage of spare parts and production materials led to a lack of transparency and limited control over inventory. Without a global spare parts logistics network, long delivery times and low inventory visibility were common issues. Additionally, high manual effort in inventory management and inefficient processes created further challenges. Urgent orders regularly caused capacity bottlenecks in logistics and shipping."},"id":"c3234992-d04f-471a-b4b1-eb76dca3b98e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"Our approach","text":"In a design sprint, we developed a strategy for optimized spare parts logistics together with ILLIG. The company decided to transition from in-house warehousing to a 4PL logistics platform and implement PartsOS Inventory for data-driven inventory planning. At the same time, seamless integration with ILLIG's SAP system was carried out. To ensure a unified global service, a central European spare parts warehouse was established. The implementation of additional modules such as PartsOS Customs, PartsOS Planning, and US Fulfillment (planned) was carried out step by step to enable sustainable scaling."},"id":"6153a9c5-6f8e-44ac-833b-893a09a55c66","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"The result","text":"With PartsCloud, ILLIG now has plug-and-play access to a global logistics network, leading to centralized inventory transparency and higher customer satisfaction through digitized processes. The transition has resulted in significant cost reductions and economies of scale that would not have been achievable with traditional 3PL logistics providers. Through automated processes and intelligent inventory management, order processing has been accelerated, and international spare parts supply has been optimizedâ€”first for Europe, and later for the US and Asia."},"id":"7be503ea-fb61-446f-bee0-f8d32eb6948a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"items":[{"title":"6 months","description":"after launch delivery performance significantly improved"},{"title":"23.5%","description":"reduction in cost per order"},{"title":"2:15h","description":"improvement in cut-off time for urgent orders"},{"title":"<0.5%","description":"customer complaint rate achieved"}]},"id":"ad427560-6001-485b-81c7-eeb67fe08f43","isHidden":false,"type":"kpisUseCase"},{"content":{"backgroundcolor":"gray","slides":[{"logo":["file://irTxN1XtRg68Kwpe"],"quote":"\"With the Spare Parts platform PartsOS from PartsCloud, we as machine builders can establish a globally unified spare parts service.\"","name":"Tobias Zimmer","position":"Vice President Service","link":[],"image":["file://62QOx6ktBcJMxnTi"]}]},"id":"ffddf3c4-71c5-40c6-adad-2c63c826d369","isHidden":false,"type":"successStorySlider"}]

Blocks: [{"content":{"title":"The problem","text":"Hymmen GmbH Maschinen- und Anlagenbau is an innovative engineering company based in Bielefeld that has been developing and distributing systems for lamination, digital printing, and surface finishing in industrial production since 1892. Like many other companies, Hymmen faced bottlenecks in customs processing and fulfillment. The mixed storage of spare parts and production materials led to complications, while long delivery times made it difficult to provide a reliable spare parts supply. Additionally, the company lacked access to 3PL outsourcing partners due to low warehouse and shipment volumes."},"id":"6264801b-a3f3-4946-9f88-160a027aa413","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"Our approach","text":"PartsCloud specializes in addressing these challenges. To improve efficiency, PartsOS Customs was first implemented for automated customs processing. At the same time, an AI-powered cleanup of customs-relevant master data was carried out, including tariff codes, classifications, and dual-use goods checks. With PartsOS Planning, demand analyses and AI-driven demand forecasting and inventory planning were introduced for the US and European markets. Additionally, the development of regional and central fulfillment centers was rolled out step by step in the US and is planned for Europe in the future. Finally, all spare parts workflows are being digitized to enable clear, cross-departmental management."},"id":"14e53950-d2ec-414f-9b7f-0ce1e86b0167","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"The result","text":"The automated tariff classification with PartsOS Customs ensures a seamless export process.

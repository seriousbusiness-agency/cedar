Blocks: [{"content":{"title":"The problem","text":"Fischer TireTech, a company specializing in equipment and technologies for the tire industry, previously managed spare parts exclusively on a \"made-to-order\" basis. This resulted in very long lead times, with customers waiting an average of 75 days for spare parts, and in peak times, even twice as long. The service level was critically low, with only 0.8% of orders being fulfilled immediately, leading customers to increasingly turn to alternative suppliers."},"id":"b733527d-75e4-48a2-85e6-8874d384a243","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"Our approach","text":"To significantly improve availability, we introduced PartsOS Planning for AI-powered demand forecasting. A comprehensive analysis identified 2,400 spare parts that would enable immediate availability for 80% of orders. Integration into the existing ERP system was carried out step by step, starting with a semi-automated inventory management process. Additionally, a proactive procurement strategy was developed to selectively stock recurring parts."},"id":"2e0faafa-d94f-409c-a593-93d099f60d49","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"title":"The result","text":"With predictive inventory management based on the \"evergreen-on-stock\" principle, critical spare parts are now immediately available. Automating inventory and procurement processes has significantly reduced manual planning efforts, while the optimized procurement strategy with minimum order quantities helps avoid unnecessary storage costs. Additionally, PartsOS Fulfillment was integrated to further shorten delivery times and ensure efficient processing."},"id":"b7f855be-bd89-4e65-8141-b2d6158da275","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"items":[{"title":"80%","description":"of orders saw delivery times reduced from 75 days to under 4 days"},{"title":"€45,000","description":"reduction in administrative costs per year"},{"title":"10%","description":"increase in spare parts sales due to higher availability"},{"title":"3%","description":"increase in machine sales through improved customer trust in spare parts supply"}]},"id":"92d68b07-e362-4a28-b8aa-30840ea03270","isHidden":false,"type":"kpisUseCase"},{"content":{"backgroundcolor":"gray","slides":[{"logo":["file://0bzomZcLtW7Vaw7p"],"quote":"\"With PartsOS Planning, we have implemented a data-driven, forward-looking spare parts strategy for the first time.
